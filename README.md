I am reading SICP 2nd-Edition as part of the learning path on
teachyourselfcs.com. The recommendation is to read the first three chapters and
do most of the exercises. This is what I plan to do! I'm also watching the
lectures on youtube.

Using [racket](https://docs.racket-lang.org/guide/index.html) with the
[SICP](package) as my scheme interpreter.
